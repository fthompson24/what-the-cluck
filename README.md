# What-the-Cluck
# A Nashville Hot Chicken Directory


An app created to help the user easily find Nashville hot chicken near you and introduce the user
to places a user might otherwise not have known about.
This app is targeted both toward locals and tourists alike. 
When I want to try a new restaurant, or a tourist wants to try NHC, they have a location to easily find places that arenâ€™t national chains.

Goal of helping support small local businesses.
